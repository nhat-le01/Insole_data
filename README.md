# Insole_data
The purpose of the program is to determine if a patient needs joint pain treatment by using deep learning networks to analyze the
data recored by sensors in patients' shoe. This is an ongoing project that I'm working with a professor at my school. The program is written
mostly in python. We'll try to find the best model by trying different deep learning networks. The first trial is using a convolutional neural
network.
